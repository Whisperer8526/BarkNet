# About the project

These are my first steps in data science, machine learning and coding in general. Therefore, any kind of useful suggestions, remarks or opinions will be highly appreciated. Feel free to use the code and apply it to your own data. 

The goal of this project is to explore possibilities and finally create small yet efficent model to classify tree species based on processed images of their bark. This approach was chosen due to the fact that other morphological features as e.g. leaves or buds are not always available throughout the year in temperate climare zone, or might be unreachable because of the tree height. Moreover, the process of gathering data in form of photos taken at the eye-level is much faster and makes collecting required dataset possible in reasonable amount of time. 

This choice, howerver, poses a challenge since bark of certain tree species may look almost identical and model is expected to lose some prediction accuracy especially between some pairs of species (e.g beech / hornbeam). On the other hand, species, such as birch are easily distinguishable even by untrained eye and shouldn't cause any major accuracy loss.

# Dataset 

Data has been collected in early spring of 2021, entirely in direct neighbourhood of Rzepin located in western part of Poland. The species included in the project occur naturally in Central Europe and at the moment these are:

  1. European beech (Fagus sylvatica)
  2. Silver birch (Betula pendula)
  3. Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus)
  4. Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur)
  5. Scots pine (Pinus sylverstris)
