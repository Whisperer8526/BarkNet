# Tree-Bark-Recognizer

This is my first project, which will be developed in coming weeks. It's gonna be model based on neural network,
able to recogonize few basic tree species from the area of Central Europe. 

First step will be collection of data and processing it. The photos will be taken with main camera of Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro
and then resized to 224 x 224 pixels.
All images will be renamed following patter "<number>-<species label>"
